    Lists days information for a given date interval.

    All days from the beginning of current month to the end of following month
    are returned by default.
  parameters:
    - name: filters

        JSON specifying filter conditions.

        Accepts the same format as returned by the [queries](https://www.openproject.org/docs/api/endpoints/queries/)
        endpoint. Currently supported filters are:

        + date: the inclusive date interval to scope days to look up. When
          unspecified, default is from the beginning of current month to the end
          of following month.

          Example: `{ "date": { "operator": "<>d", "values": ["2022-05-02","2022-05-26"] } }`
          would return days between May 5 and May 26 2022, inclusive.

        + working: when `true`, returns only the working days. When `false`,
          returns only the non-working days (weekend days and non-working days).
          When unspecified, returns both working and non-working days.

          Example: `{ "working": { "operator": "=", "values": ["t"] } }`
          would exclude non-working days from the response.
      example: '[{ "date": { "operator": "<>d", "values": ["2022-05-02","2022-05-26"] } }, { "working": { "operator": "=", "values": ["f"] } }]'
